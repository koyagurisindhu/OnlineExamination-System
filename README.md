# OnlineExamination-System
The first project I worked on was an online examination system.
This project allowed me to explore the world of web development and learn how to create a user-friendly interface for an online exam.
I was able to implement features such as user authentication, 
a timer for the exam, 
and automatic submission of answers.
I also learned how to use Java technologies such as Servlets and JSPs to create dynamic web pages.
